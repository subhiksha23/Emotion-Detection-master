# 🎭 Emotion Detection Using AI

This project is a real-time emotion detection system using computer vision and deep learning. It detects faces from your webcam feed and classifies facial expressions into five categories:

- 😠 Angry  
- 😀 Happy  
- 😐 Neutral  
- 😢 Sad  
- 😲 Surprise  

## 📸 Demo

The application opens your webcam and draws a rectangle around detected faces while displaying the predicted emotion label.
